              Winston & Strawn LLP created another law firm marketing video for a different purpose: to
              showcase their pro bono work related to LGBTQIA issues. By highlighting how they provided
              legal services to the Tyler Clementi Foundation which helps combat bullying, supported
              transgender, gender nonconforming, and non-binary individuals in changing their legal
              names, and fought to win asylum for persecuted people all over the world, Winston & Strawn
              distinguishes itself within a massive sea of competitors whose names often sound similar and
              where it’s not always easy to tell firms apart.
